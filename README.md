# Landing-Page
I am creating a landing page completely from scratch. This webpage showcases my ability to use CSS, flexbox, and HTML. Classes will be used to seperate different flexboxes and flex-items from each other so that they can be aligned properly. The concept design was inspired from the Odin Project. However, all the code is completely mine.

The idea of the landing page will be in connection of the "recipes" project. It will be about learning to cook your own meals at home. The design will be a bit different from the original project created by The Odin Project.

# Landing-Page
This Landing Page will contain everything that I have learned up until now. Using flexbox, css, and HTML, I will be making my own landing startup page.

The idea of the landing page will be in connection of the "recipes" project. It will be about learning to cook your own meals at home. The design will be a bit different from the original project created by The Odin Project.
